title: A Curious Lead Codex in the Baths of Diocletian
---

A little over a year ago, while photographing various objects held in museums in Rome, I came across the following strange artifact in the Epigraphic Museum of the Baths of Diocletian:

The museum placard reads thus: [^placard]

> ***Libello "basilidiano"***
> 
> *Libello formato da sette pagine racchiuse da un copertina con la testa di una donna velata e di un uomo barbato. Nelle pagine opistigrafe, sono incise coppie di figure, umane e animali in probabile successione, e un testo ricco di segni magici (*charaktères*), che non sembra avere senso compiuto.*
>
> *Provenienza ignota, già nel Museo Kircheriano - IV-V sec. d.C.?*
>
> **A little book**
> 
> A book formed of seven pages enclosed by a cover with a veiled woman's head and a bearded man. On the inside pages, engraved on both sides, a couple of human and animal figures are depicted probably at a latter date. Even the date [sic][^placard], rich of magic signs (*charaktères*), does not seem to make sense.
>
> Origin unknown, already in the Kircherian museum - IV-V century AD?

The object was intriguing to me, as a metal codex is a relatively novel form, and I'd heard nothing of this particular object during the [Jordan Lead Codices controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lead_Codices) (what ever came of that?). Mormons also have [an especially strong interest in trying to prove the existence of a tradition of metal codices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement_and_engraved_metal_plates), and seem from my investigations to have no idea of the existence of this one. Surprisingly, this object is also nowhere to be found in the [2004 museum catalog](http://www.worldcat.org/title/epigraphic-collection-of-the-museo-nazionale-romano-at-the-baths-of-diocletian/oclc/491836033).

The provenance on the placard is also mysterious: "Origin unknown, already in the Kircherian museum". This seemed my best foothold for finding any further information about it. First off, what's the Kircherian museum? According to [the Italian Wikipedia page](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_kircheriano):

> *Il Museo kircheriano fu una raccolta pubblica di antichità e curiosità ([Wunderkammer](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderkammer)), fondata nel 1651 dal padre gesuita Athanasius Kircher nel Collegio Romano.*
>
> The Kirchner Museum was a public collection of antiquities and curiosities ([Wunderkammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities)), founded in 1651 by the Jesuit father Athanasius Kircher in the Roman College.

Apparently over the ages the collection was dissolved and reabsorbed into various other collections. The rough timeline seems to be that this object remained[^remained] in the Museo Kircheriano at the Collegio Romano[^helbig] until its ultimate division in 1913,[^kircherian1913] ending up in its present location. Where, when, how, and even in what form it came into the Kircherian is debatable.

Chasing down publications about this object has proven difficult and confusing, as there are (or were), potentially three different but superficially similar Basilidian lead codices which seem to have appeared in Rome around the same time:

 * the one currently preserved in the museum (7 plates, 2 figures and 5 lines on each)
 * a different one published by Phillippo Bonanni, mentioned in his 1709 catalog of the museum, but "vanished" or replaced with the present one sometime before 1837 (7 plates, 2 figures and 4 lines on each?)
 * a still different one purchased in Rome by [Bernard de Montfaucon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_de_Montfaucon) in 1699 then donated to [Cardinal de Bouillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_de_Bouillon), which also vanished sometime before 1828 (6 plates, 1 figure on each and 4 lines on some)

Out of all the publications relating to these objects, Bonanni is the only one who seems to give any sort of potential provenance information ("*Fuit hic plumbeus liber repertus in antiquo Sarcophago, in quo cineres demortui fuerant inclusi. Constat autem ex pluribus monumentis, ab Aethnicis praecipuè Aegyptiis non rarò in sepulchris aliqua deposita fuisse*").

What I propose to set forth in this post is a chronological bibliography of everything I've found relating to these three lead codices, providing transcriptions of the original texts and a rough pass at English translation where applicable.[^trnote] My hope is that collecting this material will enable further scholarship in a neglected and apparently obscure area. Many of the sources I came across in my research note casually that Bonanni (and Contucci) considerably expanded the collection of antiquities in the Kircherian museum, and the provenance of many of these objects (now dispersed and displayed in other museums) is presumably similarly difficult to trace. Thus it seems to me that a useful project for an ambitious researcher interested in these matters would be to try to locate correspondence, Jesuit archives, or other unedited manuscripts related to these curators and edit them on the model of Alberto Bartola's *Alle Origini del Museo del Collegio Romano* and Nathalie Lallemand-Buyssens' *Les acquisitions d’Athanasius Kircher au musée du Collège Romain à la lumière de documents inédit*. The two sources mined by these articles are the [Apostolica Pontificia Universita Gregoriana, Rome (APUG)](http://www.archiviopug.org/) and [Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu (ARSI)](http://www.sjweb.info/arsi/), respectively, and given the size of these archives there still may be relevant material yet to be discovered.

Lallemand-Buyssens also notes the difficulty of figuring out when a particular object entered or left the museum as constituted at any particular point in time, and that many of the catalogs are not (and do not claim to be) comprehensive. However, given Kircher's interest in and voluminous writing on other gnostic artifacts in the museum, and the fact that this artifact goes unmentioned by him in any work that I can find (perhaps it was in his lost *Etruscan Journey*?), as well as its absence from the items mentioned by Bonanni as remaining in the museum as it stood in 1698 (as described in his 1716 *Notizie circa la Galleria del Collegio Romano*, an edition of which can be found in Appendix III of Bartola),[^breve] I think it is safe to assume that at least the artifact published by Bonanni in 1709 was acquired by Bonanni. That artifact's replacement with the current one may be another story entirely, and one which has apparently confounded many.

[^breve]: I also note that no *Thecam plumbeam* or similar such object is explicitly mentioned in Bonanni's undated *Breve notizia del ripartimento e delle cose conservate nel Museo del Collegio Romano eretto l’anno 1699*, believed by Bartola to have been written in the first decade of the 18th century (APUG 35 VII (g), published in Bartola's Appendix IV), though many of the categories of objects listed are broad and vague (for example, one could imagine it falling under *"libri di varie lingue"* or even perhaps *"urne varie sepolcrali ed inscrizzioni"*).

  > Dum Romae agerem, incidi in librum plumbeum, insculptum literis & figuris Basilidianorum: emtumque obtuli Serenissimo Principi Cardinali de Boüillon; ita tamen ut depicta omnia penes me remanerent. Est is libellus longitudine quatuor circiter pollicum; latitudine duorum & dimidii, ut infra delineatur: operculis vero duobus plumbeis totus compingitur, sex folia item plumbea sunt, ab utraque facie incisa literis aut figuris: duae partes operculi assumento plumbeo, clavis item plumbeis asserto & firmato, junguntur. Virgula plumbea foliis a tergo, per annulum plumbeum ipsis haerentem, inserta, ipsa folia retinet ne dimoveantur. Denique omnia plumbum. In singulis paginis Basilidianorum figurae comparent. In quatuor primis tantum, verba quaedam sub figuris posita incisa sunt. Prima & secunda pagella, Hetruscis literis exaratur; tertia & quarta Graecis; ex utrisque tamen tam Hetruscis, quam Graecis, tantumdem notitiae expisceris, adeo sunt obscura omnia & tenebris oppleta. Hactenus quod ad literas: quod ad figurae vero haec carptim dicamus.
  > In prima pagina, homo nudus stat, digitos ori admovens, qualem depingunt Harpocratem: nimirum illi fabulosa & prophana omnia sectabantur.
  > In secunda, homo veste talari indutus, manu caelum commonstrat, quo mysterio, divinet qui possit.
  > In tertia, Basilidianus quispiam junctis manibus, nudo capite precans effingitur.
  > In quarta pagina, figura humano corpore, capite volucris coronato: quales non paucae in lapillis habentur.
  > In quinta, Abraxas humano corpore, galli gallinacei capite, dextera flagellum tenens, sinistram ori admovens, tibiis in serpentis caput desinentibus: de quo pluribus supra.
  > In sexta, homo stans, capite volucris, radiato corpore, baculum manu dextera tenens: quae figura non insolita est in lapillis & gemmis.
  > In septima, caput Jobis Serapidis, qui in Basilidianorum lapillis frequentissime repraesentatur, interdum solus, nonnumquam cum aliis figuris.
  > In octava, mulier decumbens, quam figuram numquam alias inter Basilidianorum symbola vidi.
  > In nona, insectum animal, ex variis insectis compositum: qualia multa comparent in gemmis Abraxaeis.
  > In decima, rana, quod animal mirum quantum celebretur apud Basilidianos; ita ut homines ritu venerantium in conspectu ranae depingantur.
  > In undecima, avis quaedam, anseri non absimilis.
  > In duodecima, mulier, velo stellis consperso caput obvelans, quae est figura noctis: eam quidem in Basilidianorum gemmis & symbolis numquam vidimus; sed constat certissimumque est, hoc schemate noctem significari, ut supra Libro primo, capite primo videas.
  > Hinc vero subit in mentem, hunc duodenum numerum aliquid significare, & conjecturam meam, amicis probatam, Lectori benevolo aperire non pigebit. Opinor itaque hisce duodecim schematibus, duodecim diei horas indicari. Ad primam quippe diei horam homo nudus repraesentatur, quia tunc e lecto surgitur. Ad horam sextam, sive meridiem, homo gradiens radiatus volucris capite depingitur: quod symbolum est solis medium cursum tenentis. Ad duodecimam, mulier stellato velo caput obnubens, quod apertissimum est, uti jam diximus, noctis signum. Ex hisce tribus clarum videtur hic horas indicari: nam quorsum haec spectare possint? Jam vero horas singulas, quantum quidem licebit, prosequamur. Hora itaque prima Basilidianus e lecto surgit nudus: siquidem haec Basilidianos & Gnosticos spectare conspicuum est. Hora secunda, veste talari indutus, operto capite, caelum manu ostendere; aut aliud quidpiam ignotum significare videtur. Hora tertia, ut moris erat Christianis, nudo capite, junctis manibus precatur. Ad horam vero quartam, quo spectet homo ille capite & rostro volucris, coronatus, ne quidem conjectare valeam, nec quid ad quintam horam sibi velit homo galli gallinacei capite, tibiis in serpentis caput desinentibus: qua in re malo ignorantiam prositeri meam, quam levia & incerta proponere. Ad horam sectam, homo gradiens radiatus, volucris capite, baculum manu tenens, solem medium cursum tenentem adumbrat. Hora septima, Jupiter Serapis, qui teste Hadriano in epistola sua a Christianis colebatur, depingitur: quia erat *επ...αμμχ..ος θεος, Septem literarum deus*: nam totidem sunt in nomine Σεραπις, vel Σαραπις, utroque enim modo legitur. Hinc Hesychius, ...,: & vetus Epigramma:
  > ...
  > Hoc est:
  > Septem me pronuntiatae Deum magnum incorruptum laudant
  > Literae, omnium indefessum parentem.
  > Posset item fortasse dici, Serapidem hora septima, quae est prandii tempus, apponi, quia est deus frugum colendarum, quibus colligendis modium capite gestat. Ad horam octavam, mulier decumbens pomeridianum forte somnum adumbrat.
  > Ad nonam vero, quid sibi velit insectum illud ignoramus. Ad decimam, inclinante jam sole, rana depingitur, quia fortasse tum maxime coaxare & strepitus edere incipit. In undecima anser cadente sole ad quietem & cubile pacate concedit. In duodecima nox advenit, quae per mulierem stellato amictu obvelatam certissime adumbratur.
  > Hic porro notandum est, Basilidianos, ut ad solis cursum, quem in religione ponebant, repraesentandum, 365. virtutes comminiscebantur: quarum singulas & nomine, & schemate, ut creditur, proprio designabant; sic ad diurnum solis cursum, virtutes, & figuras duodenas, pro singulis horis designandis, constituisse vero simile est. Quod etiam conjecturam confirmat nostram: quam tamen eruditorum arbitrio permittimus.

  > While I was working in Rome, I came across a book of lead, engraved with Basilidian letters and figures: which I have offered the most excellent Prince Cardinal de Bouillon; all depicted in such a way that should remain in my memory. The book is about four inches in length; the size of two & a half long, as will be outlined: the two lids, however, are linked to the whole of lead, six leaves of lead within, they are now cut off from both sides of the face of the letters or figures: they take up the two parts of the lid of a lead, the key of the item on leaden alleged & confirmed, we are joined. Rod leaves behind a lead, or lead them through the ring sticking, everybody, the same leaves that retain positions. Finally, all the lead. In the individual figures of the pages of Basilidian should acquire. In the first four only, has been placed under the figure of the words of a certain tombs. In the first and second pages, Etruscan letters are written; in the third and fourth Greek; From both both, however, the Etruscans, and the Greeks, I find much knowledge, they are so filled with all matter of obscure & dark things. So much for the letters: let us discuss the different figures.
  > In the first page, a man is standing naked, fingers in his mouth and blew, what kind of paint Harpocrates: to him, of course, after all the fabulous and Laymen.
  > In the second, a man clothed with a garment down to the foot, the hand of heaven, be pointed out, which is a mystery, that is able to foresee.
  > In the third, one Basilidianis hands joined in prayer with head shape.
  > In the fourth page, the shape of the human body, the crown of the head of the bird: what kind of not a few in the little stones have been placed.
  > In the fifth day, the human body, Abraxas, the rooster head, the right hand holding the whip, left side of his mouth and blew, the legs of the serpent in the head of the State fail: in the majority of cases above.
  > In the sixth, man is standing, the head of the bird, illuminated the body, holding the stick in your right hand, which is not unusual nor is in the shape of little stones & gems.
  > In the seventh, the head Jobis Serapis, who frequently represents Basilidianis pebbles, sometimes alone, sometimes with other figures.
  > In the eighth, a woman reclining in a type never before seen among Basilidianis symbols.
  > In the ninth, an insect an animal consists of a variety of insects, the combination of: such as much more when compared to jewels set in Abraxaeis.
  > In the tenth, a frog, an animal that is to be celebrated with as much as surprising Basilidian; so that men rite worshipers before representing frogs.
  > In the eleventh, a certain bird, goose, is not unlike.
  > In the twelfth, a woman, with stars sprinkled on his head with a veil veiling, which is the shape of the night: the symbols we have never seen it, indeed, in & Basilidian with gems; but it is clear and unerring, this diagram is indicated, the night, as was the book of the first, the head of the first video.
  > But it comes up in the mind, something to signify the number of this man, the duodenum, and the meaning of it to my friends as a test, to open to the reader with a benevolent will not be troublesome. So I think these drafts twelve, twelve hours of the day indicated. For the first hour of a naked man is portrayed because then rise from bed. To noon, or afternoon, a man walking his radiant head bird painted: that is the symbol of the middle course of the tenant. To the twelfth, the head of the woman is the veil of stars, obnubens, which is very clear, as we have already said, the sign of the night. Now, of these three hours to be pointed out in this case, it seems clear, for they may be able to look at these things, for what purpose? Apply all the hours of the individual, in so far as, indeed, will be allowed, in our power. So the first hour Basilidianis from bed naked for this Basilidianis & Gnosticos look conspicuous. It is two o'clock, clothed with a garment down to the foot, having his head covered, to show that the hand of heaven; seems to signify the unknown, or any other feeling. It is three, according to custom, it was Christian, with bare head, with his hands joined in prayer:. At the hour to the fourth, which has regard to the man was the head & beak of a bird, crowned, I can not even guess at, nor what it means to take up the fifth hour of the head of a rooster, a man, the legs of the serpent in the head of the State fail: the evil of ignorance prositeri In which case, my, how insignificant in & propose uncertain. At the hour for the sect, the man that is going radiatus, the head of the bird, the staff in his hand, the course of the holder of the Sun by means of sketching. At the seventh hour, Jupiter Serapis, who is worshiped by the Christians in his letter on the testimony of the Emperor Hadrian, is painted: ... because it was a επ αμμχ..ος θεος, seven letters, O Lord, for they are so many in the name of Σεραπις, or Σαραπις, of either kind, it is read. Hence Hesychius,: ... ancient epitaph: ...
  > This is:
  > Seven pronounced for large unspoiled praise God
  > Letter, the untiring parent.
  > It would be possible to be said, too, perhaps, at the seventh hour Serapis, which is dinner time, not only because it is the god of the corn of colendarum, which carries on her head bushels of collecting. Till the eighth hour, afternoon, perhaps, the sleep of a woman lying on sketching.
  > To the ninth, however, that we do not know what it means by an insect. The tenth, the sun was already going one, painted frog, perhaps especially then croak & noise begins to eat. In the eleventh to goose the sun to bed rest and quietly retired. Twelfth night comes in, which, by the woman garbed stars winked certainly foreshadowed.
  > At this point it should be noted further, Basilidian, to return to the course of the sun, which they placed in a religious order, a representative sign, 365. virtues he recounted, of which every thing and name, and a diagram, as is believed, one's own designabant; then it belongs to the daily course of the sun, the virtues, and the figures of the twelve, for each of the designated hours, has been established, however, the same is true. This is also the meaning of it is confirmed by our own country, which, however, the judgment of the learned.

  > Box of lead stated in Table 60. in the form of a compact book, in which seven lead plates are also included, and in each of the many characters are incised along the back, and certainly not one language, but many languages; selected, for they are some of the Greek alphabet, some, indeed, from the Hebrew, many of the ancient Etruscans, but various from the Latin. The character combinations form intelligible words, which is neither Greek nor Hebrew nor Latin talk, although [even the] highly skilled could never understand. Was added to some plates are also for every one of the symbols, but none of them can be deduced, why do you be an artist in mind, she had conceived, that he would tell. For this reason, I judge to be in the genus of talismans of enumerating, in which the Antiquorum superstition is that Place signified, that the erroneous conceived in his mind, which he thought to be the best remedy, or to the evils of the embezzlement of, or to scare away the demons, or most secure way to good things consecutiouem, which was his and forecast.

But it is evident from a number of the tombs, have not infrequently among the graves, some from the deposited's a pagan especially the Egyptians to have been, that might placate the ghosts, or to scare away the demons may prove useful in opinion. From Cornelius Tacitus Annal. lib. 2. we have, concerning the death of Germanicus slain by poison, *incantations and spells, and the name of Germanicus inscribed on leaden tablets, half-burnt cinders smeared with blood, and other horrors by which in popular belief souls are devoted to the infernal deities*. [^tacitus] Where in the notes to Louis D'Orleans "New Thoughts",[^dorleans] the ancients used plates of lead, to avoid that those names would be wiped out easily.

  > ***Libello basilidiano di piombo***
  > *(al. c. 10, lar. c. 9)*
  > *La copertura del libro ha sul diritto, in rilievo, un busto di donna velata, sul rovescio quello d’un uomo barbato. Dentro erano, per mezzo di cerniera, riunite sette sottili tavolette di piombo della medesima grandezza, che ora sono sciolte, ciascuna delle quali contiene, ai due lati, incise due figure simboliche nella parte superiore, e una leggenda nel rimanente. Una strana mescolanza di lettere greche, italiche e latine non ne rende possibile alcuna decifrazione; il carattere gnostico dell’insieme è però indubitato. Il Bonanni menziona (mus. Kirch. p. 180), pubblicandone un saggio (tav. LX), un analogo monumento, che pare sia stato ai suoi tempi trovato in Roma, ed era conservato nel Museo. Esso però era affatto diverso dal nostro, come pure dall’altro acquistato in Roma dal Montfaucon nel 1699 e donato da lui al cardinale de Bauillon [sic] (palaeogr. graeca p. 181; cf. antiq. expliq. 2, 2, pl. 177). È ignoto come e quando sia scomparso il primo del Museo, sostituendovisi quest’altro. Il Brunati, (p. 122) per altro, già notò nel 1838 questa sostituzione, manifestando qualche dubbio sulla sua autenticità, e concludendo che tutti e tre i sudetti libelli possano pervenire da una medesima origine.*

  > **Basilidian book of lead**
  > The cover of the book on the right, in relief, a bust of a veiled woman, on the reverse that of a bearded man. Inside were, by means of zipper, gathered seven thin lead tablets of the same size, which are now dissolved, each of which contains two sides, recorded two symbolic figures at the top, and a legend in the remainder. A strange mixture of Greek letters, Italic and Latin does not make any decryption possible; the Gnostic character of the whole, however, is undoubted. Bonanni mentions (mus. Kirch. P. 180), publishing in an essay (plate. LX), a similar work, which seems to have been found in Rome in his time, and was preserved in the Museum. However, it was not at all different from ours, as well as the other purchased in Rome by Montfaucon in 1699 and donated by him to Cardinal de Bouillon (palaeogr. Graeca p. 181; cf. antiq. Expliq. 2, 2, pl. 177) . It is unknown how and when it vanished the first of the Museum, replacing (the face of?) this other. Brunati, (p. 122) for one, already noticed in 1838 this replacement, expressing some doubt about its authenticity, and concluded that all three of these pamphlets can come from the same origin.

  > We now come to relics of the same sort [i.e. leaden], but of diverse intention; being those passports to eternal bliss, so frequently mentioned in the course of the preceding dissertation. Of these the most complete example is the Leaden Book formerly belonging to the celebrated Father Kircher, in whose collection it first made its appearance, but concerning the *provenance* of which nothing is known, although Matter *suspects* it to be the same that Montfaucon gave to Cardinal Bouillon, who died at Rome in 1715. But this identification is entirely ungrounded, as shall presently be shown. The same writer has given facsimiles, in his 'Excursion Gnostique,' of the seven pages composing the book, now deposited in the Museum Kircherianum. These leaves are of lead, 3 × 4 inches square, engraved on each side, with a religious composition for heading, under which are, in every case, *five* lines of inscription, that mystic number having doubtless been purposely adopted by the spell-maker. These lines are written in large Greek capitals, square-shaped, and resembling the character commonly used on Gnostic gems. Intermixed are other forms, some resembling the hieroglyphs still current for the Signs and Planets; others Egyptian Demotic and Pehlevi letters. The language does not appear to be Coptic, but rather some Semitic tongue, many words being composed entirely of *consonants*, showing that the vowels were to be supplied by the reader. The chief interest, however, of the relic lies in the designs heading each page, in which we recognise the usual figures of Gnostic iconology, together with others of a novel character, all touched in with a free and bold graver with the fewest possible strokes. The purport of the writing underneath may be conjectured, on the authority of the 'Litany of the Dead'[^kingfn1] and the 'Diagramma of the Ophites,' to be the prayers addressed by the ascending soul to these particular deities, each in his turn. The very number of the pages, seven in all, comes to support this explanation. The Astral Presidents to be propitiated in the heavenward journey are represented in the following manner:--
  > 1. A nude female figure, in which the navel (the "circle of the Sun") is strongly defined: she makes a gesture of adoration to a genius in a conical cap and short tunic, armed with a trident, Siva's proper weapon, and consequently appropriated afterwards by the mediæval Ruler of Tartarus.
  > *Reverse*. Palm within a circle or garland, and a large Caduceus.
  > 2. Female in flowing robes, addressing a gigantic fowl, much too squat, apparently, in its proportions for the ibis of Thoth: perhaps intended for the yet more divine bird, the phoenix.
  > *Reverse*. Nude female adoring a certain undefined monster, furnished with large ears, and placed upon a low altar. The first line of the accompanying prayer seems to begin with the Pehlevi letters equivalent to S, P, V.
  3. Horus, leaning upon an instrument of unknown use, regarding a huge tortoise, better drawn than the rest, which is crawling towards him.
  > *Reverse*. Female in long flowing robes, holding up her hands to a naked child (Horus?), who is in the act of leaping down to her from a lofty pedestal.
  > 4. Anubis attired in a short mantle (reminding one of Mephistopheles) attentively contemplating a lofty hill, the apex whereof has the form of an eagle's head.
  > *Reverse*. Female in rags leaning on a staff advancing towards another richly clothed and crowned, who lifts up her hands as though terrified at the apparition.
  > 5. Abraxas in his proper form, looking towards a female fully draped, who offers him some indistinct symbol, much resembling an **Ε** turned upside down. The prayer below opens with the word **ΙΑΩ**; whence it may be fairly conjectured that the first characters in each of the other pages give the name of the deity pictured above.
  > *Reverse*. Frog and serpent facing each other: ancient emblems of Spring, but probably used here in their mediæval sense as types of the Resurrection of the body.
  > 6. A headless man with rays issuing from his shoulders, and holding out a torch, appears falling backwards with affright on the approach of a winged dragon.
  > *Reverse*. A squat personage with radiated crown stands in front face in the attitude of the Egyptian Typhon. On the other side stands a very indistinct figure, resembling a Cupid, having square-cut wings, his back turned to the spectator.
  > 7. Female with robe flying in an arch over her head, as Iris is commonly pictured, extends her hand to an approaching bull: the drawing of the latter being vastly superior to any of the other figures. One is led to discover in this group Venus and her tutelary sign, Taurus.
  > *Reverse*. Female reclining on the ground, towards whom advances a large bird, seemingly meant for a pigeon.
  > In the sacred animals figuring in these successive scenes it is impossible to avoid discovering an allusion to the forms the Gnostics gave to the planetary Rulers. A legend of theirs related how the Saviour in his descent to this lower world escaped the vigilance of these Powers by assuming their own form as he traversed the sphere of each, whence a conjecture may be hazarded that similar metamorphoses of the illumined soul are hinted at in these inexplicable pictures.
  > We now come to the consideration of a second relic of the same kind, known as "Card. Bouillon's Leaden Book." How Matter could have supposed this to be the same with Kircher's (supposing him ever to have compared his own facsimiles with Montfaucon's) is a thing totally beyond my comprehension. For Montfaucon, in his Plate 187, has given every leaf of the former, apparently copied with sufficient fidelity: the pictures on which I shall proceed to describe for the purpose of comparison with those in the Kircherian volume; for the general analogy in the designs attests the similar destination of both monuments, whilst at the same time the variation in details proves the existence of two distinct specimens of this interesting class.
  > The leaves within the two covers, connected by rings secured by a rod passed through them, are only six in number; whilst the inscriptions, though in much the same lettering as the Kircherian copy, fill only four lines on a page, and only four pages in all: the other eight pages having pictures alone.
  > Now to describe these pictures, which seem in better drawing than those of the former set.[^kingfn2] Page 1. Man, nude, standing up. 2. Female fully draped, walking. 3. The same figure, extending one hand. 4. Anubis in a short mantle. 5. The usual figure of the Abraxas god. 6. Bird-headed man surrounded with rays (Phre?). 7. Bust of Serapis. 8. Female reclining. 9. Terminal figure in the form of a cross. 10. Frog. 11. Ibis, or Phoenix. 12. Female holding above her head a star-spangled veil.
  > Montfaucon supposes all these figures represent the genii who preside over the hours of the day--the first being expressive of rising, the last of night; and calls attention to the fact that the seventh page is assigned to Serapis, who sometimes receives the title of ἑπταγράμματος θεός. But in his Plate 188, Montfaucon copies from Bononi's 'Museum Kircherianum' another leaden book "found in a sepulchre," which actually has seven pages, and two figures heading each, in the specimen pages: and this may possibly be the one since published in its entirety by Matter; although at present the leaves are separate, not connected into a book, which may be the result of accident during the century and a half that has elapsed since it was first noticed.

  > **Leaden Book.**
  > Each cover of this book bears a bust in relief in the centre, the front cover a veiled woman, the back cover a bearded man. Within the covers were seven very thin leaden leaves, originally fastened by a hinge but now exhibited separately. They are inscribed on both sides with an unintelligible series of Greek, Latin, and Italic letters, while in the upper third of each page are scratched two human or animal figures, or two symbols. The source of this book is not quite clear. The style and the writing are both very remarkable, but the article is held to be genuine and is believed to be a mystical book of the Basilidian Gnostics.

[^placard]: I would note here that the English translation, for some reason, omits "basilidian," and seemingly mistranslates "*testo*" ("text") as "date".
[^remained]: I make this assertion on the basis that Reisch describes observing the codex in the Kircherian as it remained in 1891. The Baths of Diocletian was instituted as the inaugural seat of the Museo Nazionale Romano in 1890, so the codex may have been moved between then and the Kircherian's ultimate dissolution 1913.

Leipsic, Karl Baedeker, 1896](https://archive.org/details/guidetopubliccol02helbuoft). p.415-416: *"The Museo Kircheriano derives its name from the German Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), a native of the neighbourhood of Fulda, who became a professor in the Collegio Romano about 1635. At Rome he indulged his mathematical and historical tastes by the formation of a collection of curiosities, which, besides natural productions of all kinds and specimens of all branches of artistic industry, included also a few unimportant antiques. It was not until the eighteenth century that this collection, chiefly owing to the exertions of Bonanni and Contucci, assumed more and more the character of a cabinet of antiques; and about the same time (ca. 1738) it acquired its chief treasure, the Ficoronian Cist. During the suspension of the order of the Jesuits (1773-1823) the Museo Kircheriano was more and more neglected in favour of the great papal collections in the Vatican and at the Capitol. But in the present century the famous archaeologist Giuseppe Marchi turned his attention to the neglected museum; under his auspices the section of Christian antiquities, the collection of leaden missiles for slings, and that of water-pipes received large additions, while the treasure-trove of Vicarello and the celebrated graffito of the 'Caricature Crucifixion' were also added to the museum under his management. The Collegio Romano and its collections became the property of the state in 1870; and since then the Museo Kircheriano has been completely re-arranged on a scientific system. The Graeco-Roman and Christian antiquities have been combined in a special section by Ettore de Ruggiero (in the rooms to the left of the entrance). The ethnographical specimens were transferred to the Museo Nazionale Preistorico ed Etnografico, opened in 1876, a collection that already, under the management of Luigi Pigorini, has risen to the rank of a museum of the first class, and is still constantly receiving additions. [...] According to the present (interim) arrangement, the Museo Kircheriano occupies the saloon to the left of the principal entrance and the two adjoining rooms."*

He attacks with spear in hand the crocodiles, lizards, scorpions and snakes which beset his path; and passing through these dark regions he at length reaches the land of the Amenti, whose goddess is a hawk standing upon a perch. Here the sun's rays cheer his steps, and he meets amongst other wonders the head of Horus rising out of a lotus-flower, the god Pthah, the phoenix, his own soul in the form of a bird with a human head, and the goddess Isis as a serpent of goodness. The soul then returns to the mummy and puts life into its mouth."--(Sharpe, 'Egypt. Mythol.,' p. 65.)"

This led to grievous insults on Piso, while he as savagely assailed the prince. Piso then resolved to quit Syria. Soon he was detained there by the failing health of Germanicus, but when he heard of his recovery, while people were paying the vows they had offered for his safety, he went attended by his lictors, drove away the victims placed by the altars with all the preparations for sacrifice, and the festal gathering of the populace of Antioch. Then he left for Seleucia and awaited the result of the illness which had again attacked Germanicus. The terrible intensity of the malady was increased by the belief that he had been poisoned by Piso. And certainly there were found hidden in the floor and in the walls disinterred remains of human bodies, incantations and spells, and the name of Germanicus inscribed on leaden tablets, half-burnt cinders smeared with blood, and other horrors by which in popular belief souls are devoted to the infernal deities. Piso too was accused of sending emissaries to note curiously every unfavourable symptom of the illness.*
