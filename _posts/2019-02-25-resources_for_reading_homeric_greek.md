Recently, [I've been reading some Homeric Greek](https://twitter.com/ryanfb/status/1099705793874743296), and thought it would be useful to collect some resources I've found useful or interesting in the process. Similar to my [Ancient Greek Textbooks Roundup]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-02-ancient_greek_textbooks_roundup %}) post, this is just a post for gathering everything together in one place for convenient reference.

# Grammars/Introductions for Homeric Greek

## *Homeric Greek: A Book For Beginners*
### Clyde Pharr

[The original 1920 version of this book is freely-available in the public domain](https://archive.org/details/homericgreekabo01phargoog/), but there have been two later revisions of itâ€”one by John Wright in 1985, and [a further revision by Paula Debnar which is curently in print from the University of Oklahoma Press](https://amzn.to/2H117Nc). This textbook is designed for students with no background in Greek, leading them through the grammar of Homeric Greek in particular, culminating in readings of *Iliad* 1.1-611.

## [*Beginning Greek with Homer*](https://amzn.to/2EuJy6z)
### Frank Beetham

Similar to Pharr, this book is designed for students with no background in Greek, guiding them through grammar for Homeric Greek, and leading them through a reading of *Odyssey* 5. See also [this review in BMCR](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1999/1999-04-19.html).

## *A Reading Course in Homeric Greek*

## [*Homer: A Transitional Reader*](https://amzn.to/2H0qG0N)
### John H. O'Neil and Timothy F. Winters

Unlike the other books in this category, this book is designed for introducing Homeric Greek to students who already have some background in Attic Greek.

## Attikos/Perseus

A significant portion of my reading is done in the excellent [Attikos](https://attikos.org/) app from the University of Chicago. You can tap on any word for a quick parse and definition, or open a full definition in the corresponding Logeion dictionary app. I'll often split-screen this on my iPad with a PDF open in the [Documents](https://readdle.com/documents) app. You can also read texts online in any web browser with [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) or [Perseus under PhiloLogic](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/).

# Readers/Commentaries/Scholia

## D Scholia

The so-called "D" Scholia come from an ancient schoolbook tradition, and largely consist of glosses on Homer. These are not available in English translation, but can be very valuable for reading while staying "in language," as often these scholia will give an expanded Greek explanation for a confusing bit of Homeric Greek. Two excellent editions of these scholia are freely available as PDFs:

* [Helmut van Thiel, *Scholia D in Iliadem*](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5586/)
* [Nicola Ernst, *Die D-Scholien zur Odyssee*](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/1831/)

## Geoffrey Steadman

[Geoffrey Steadman](https://geoffreysteadman.com/) generously publishes his readers/commentaries for various ancient works as free PDFs and inexpensive print-on-demand paperbacks:

* [*Odyssey* 6-8](https://geoffreysteadman.com/homers-odyssey-6-8/) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Ew3kP2))

# Translations

Although [there are no end of available translations of Homer](http://whichtranslation.com/homer/), the English translation which is likely to be most useful for the purpose of aiding a reading of the Greek is that of Richmond Lattimore:

* The [*Iliad*](https://amzn.to/2H2EBTT)
* The [*Odyssey*](https://amzn.to/2Izrmws)

These also have the advantage of having standalone commentaries available based off of them:

* [*A Companion to The Iliad: Based on the Translation by Richmond Lattimore*](https://amzn.to/2IDYkvH) by M.M. Willcock (same editor/commentator as the Bristol Classical Press edition of the Iliad)
* [*Homer's Odyssey: A Commentary based on the English Translation of Richmond Lattimore*](https://amzn.to/2H8fNu3) by Peter Jones

# Paraphrases

Perhaps an odd category, but over the years various people have made Attic/Koine Greek paraphrases of Homer. Similar to the D Scholia, these can help with reading Homer while staying "in language."
