Recently, [I've been reading some Homeric Greek](https://twitter.com/ryanfb/status/1099705793874743296), and thought it would be beneficial to collect some resources I've found useful or interesting in the process. Similar to my [Ancient Greek Textbooks Roundup]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-02-ancient_greek_textbooks_roundup %}) post, this is just a post for gathering everything together in one place for convenient reference.

# Grammars/Introductions for Homeric Greek

## *Homeric Greek: A Book For Beginners*
### Clyde Pharr

[The original 1920 version of this book is freely-available in the public domain](https://archive.org/details/homericgreekabo01phargoog/), but there have been two later revisions of itâ€”one by John Wright in 1985, and [a further revision by Paula Debnar which is curently in print from the University of Oklahoma Press](https://amzn.to/2H117Nc). This textbook is designed for students with no background in Greek, leading them through the grammar of Homeric Greek in particular, culminating in readings of *Iliad* 1.1-611. There's also an excellent web site with a vast amount of supplementary material (videos, exercises, etc.) for the book available here: <https://commons.mtholyoke.edu/hrgs/>

## [*Beginning Greek with Homer*](https://amzn.to/2EuJy6z)
### Frank Beetham

Similar to Pharr, this book is designed for students with no background in Greek, guiding them through grammar for Homeric Greek, and leading them through a reading of *Odyssey* 5. See also [this review in BMCR](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1999/1999-04-19.html).

## *A Reading Course in Homeric Greek*
### Raymond V. Schoder, Vincent C. Horrigan, and Leslie Collins Edwards

* [*A Reading Course in Homeric Greek: Book 1*](https://amzn.to/2ExvuJn) ([Review in BMCR](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-09-27.html))
* [*A Reading Course in Homeric Greek: Book 2*](https://amzn.to/2SqKoot)
* [*Transition to Attic Greek: A Supplement to "A Reading Course in Homeric Greek"*](https://amzn.to/2XqFgof)

This book is also designed for students with no background in Greek. Book 1 focuses on *Odyssey* 9 (alongside various other selections), while Book 2 goes through *Odyssey* 6 & 12.

## [*Homer: A Transitional Reader*](https://amzn.to/2H0qG0N)
### John H. O'Neil and Timothy F. Winters

Unlike the other books in this category, this book is designed for introducing Homeric Greek to students who already have some background in Attic Greek. Specific passages covered are all selections from the *Iliad*: 1.1-21, 1.121-39, 1.148-60, 1.172-87, 3.328-39, 5.297-352, 6.421-39, 16.306-57, 16.843-61, 18.97-116, 22.306-30. See also [this review in BMCR](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2011/2011-05-51.html).

## [*A Grammar of the Homeric Dialect*](https://archive.org/details/grammarofhomeric00monruoft)
### D.B. Monro

While this book has the advantage of being in the public domain, it is probably most suitable as a reference grammar to Homeric Greek for someone who has already learned some amount of Ancient Greek.

# Editions

## Bristol Classical Press
### M.M. Willcock, W.B. Stanford

These combine a Greek edition with corresponding English commentary at the back of each volume:

## Teubner
### Martin L. West, ed.

The best introduction to West's edition (and an excellent overview of the issues involved generally) may be the series of reviews and exchanges surrounding it in BMCR. Start with [Gregory Nagy's review of the first volume](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-09-12.html) and [Jean-Fabrice Nardelli's of the second volume](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2001/2001-06-21.html), and [West's response](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2001/2001-09-06.html). If you're still interested in more, there's an exchange over West's [*Studies in the Text and Transmission of the Iliad*](https://amzn.to/2XowuXG) ([review](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2002/2002-11-15.html), [response](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-17.html)), as well as [a review of West's (posthumous) *Odyssey* edition](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2019/2019-01-05.html).

* [*Iliad* 1-12](https://amzn.to/2Eyap1z)
* [*Iliad* 13-24](https://amzn.to/2Xocuob)
* [*Odyssey*](https://amzn.to/2XoTq9h)

## Cambridge
### Walter Leaf, ed.

* [*Iliad* 1-12](https://amzn.to/2IM5Q7E) ([public domain edition](https://archive.org/details/iliadhome01home))
* [*Iliad* 13-24](https://amzn.to/2IPDwBJ) ([public domain edition](https://archive.org/details/iliadhom02home))

## Attikos/Perseus

A significant portion of my reading is done in the excellent [Attikos](https://attikos.org/) app from the University of Chicago. You can tap on any word for a quick parse and definition, or open a full definition in the corresponding Logeion dictionary app. I'll often split-screen this on my iPad with a PDF open in the [Documents](https://readdle.com/documents) app. You can also read texts online in any web browser with [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) or [Perseus under PhiloLogic](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/).

## Hypotactic

David Chamberlain has recorded audio for all of the *Iliad* & (as of this writing) *Odyssey* 1-7, presented alongside a fully scanned text, available online at [*A Reading of Homer*](http://hypotactic.com/my-reading-of-homer-work-in-progress/) (work in progress) on [Hypotactic.com](https://hypotactic.com/). He also has fully parsed versions of *Odyssey* 6 & 7 available [here](http://hypotactic.com/projects/).

## The Chicago Homer

[*The Chicago Homer*](https://homer.library.northwestern.edu/splash.html) presents many Homeric works in an online interface with optional interlinear translations, as well as clickable parses for each word. Martin Mueller has also written [an introduction to using *The Chicago Homer*](https://homer.library.northwestern.edu/tutorial.html).

## Bloomsbury

Perhaps an outlier when people think of "Homeric Greek," but Bloomsbury have recently published an edition (with text, translation, and commentary) of [The Homeric Battle of Frogs and Mice](https://amzn.to/2XnNPjC), edited by Joel P. Christensen and Erik Robinson. The relative shortness, ease, and weirdness of the text can make it an excellent candidate for transitioning to reading Homeric Greek.

# Lexica

## [*A Lexicon of the Homeric Dialect*](https://amzn.to/2tDaieT)
### Richard John Cunliffe

This edition expands Cunliffe's *Lexicon* with his *Homeric Proper and Place Names*. Originally published in 1924, [the *Lexicon* is definitively in the public domain in the U.S. as of 2020](https://archive.org/details/mdp.39015005687283).

## [*A Homeric Dictionary for Schools and Colleges*](https://amzn.to/2XklhaJ)
### Georg Autenrieth, translated by Robert P. Keep

Originally published in German by Autenrieth, the English translation of this dictionary was published in 1889 and is [freely available in the public domain](https://archive.org/details/ahomericdiction00autegoog). It's also available as a digitized dictionary within [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) and [Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu/).

# Readers, Commentaries, & Scholia

## D Scholia

The so-called "D" Scholia come from an ancient schoolbook tradition, and largely consist of glosses on Homer. These are not available in English translation, but can be very valuable for reading while staying "in language," as often these scholia will give an expanded Greek explanation for a confusing bit of Homeric Greek. Two excellent editions of these scholia are freely available as PDFs:

* [Helmut van Thiel, *Scholia D in Iliadem*](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5586/)
* [Nicola Ernst, *Die D-Scholien zur Odyssee*](https://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/1831/)

## Geoffrey Steadman

[Geoffrey Steadman](https://geoffreysteadman.com/) generously publishes his readers/commentaries for various ancient works as free PDFs and inexpensive print-on-demand paperbacks:

* [*Iliad* 6 & 22](https://geoffreysteadman.com/iliad-6-22/) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Xo5w2n))
* [*Odyssey* 6-8](https://geoffreysteadman.com/homers-odyssey-6-8/) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Ew3kP2))
* [*Odyssey* 9-12](https://geoffreysteadman.com/files-odyssey-9-12/) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Ewp8d2))
* [*Odyssey* 17-20](https://geoffreysteadman.com/odyssey-17-20-preview/) (beta, PDF only)

## Pamela Draper

These readers/commentaries are somewhere between the level of Steadman's and the more general "Introductions to Homeric Greek" listed above:

* [*An Odyssey Reader: Selections from Homer's* Odyssey, *Books* 1-12](https://amzn.to/2QcEhWX)

## Charles Anthon

Originally published to cover [the first three books of the Iliad](https://archive.org/details/firstthreebookso00anthiala), this work was later expanded as [*The First Six Books of Homer's Iliad: with English Notes, Critical and Explanatory, a Metrical Index, and Homeric Glossary*](https://archive.org/details/firstsixbooksofh00homeuoft/) - both are in the public domain.

# Translations

Although [there are no end of available translations of Homer](http://whichtranslation.com/homer/), the English translation which is likely to be most useful for the purpose of aiding a reading of the Greek is that of Richmond Lattimore:

* The [*Iliad*](https://amzn.to/2H2EBTT)
* The [*Odyssey*](https://amzn.to/2Izrmws)

These also have the advantage of having standalone commentaries available based off of them:

* [*A Companion to The Iliad: Based on the Translation by Richmond Lattimore*](https://amzn.to/2IDYkvH) by M.M. Willcock (same editor/commentator as the Bristol Classical Press edition of the Iliad)
* [*Homer's Odyssey: A Commentary based on the English Translation of Richmond Lattimore*](https://amzn.to/2H8fNu3) by Peter Jones

# Paraphrases

Perhaps an odd category, but over the years various people have made Attic/Koine Greek paraphrases of Homer. Similar to the D Scholia, these can help with reading Homer while staying "in language."
