# Books
- [*Algorithms of Oppression*, Safiya Umoja Noble](https://amzn.to/34TxMxa): essential reading if you're interested in algorithmic bias and the power of Big Tech.
- [*Binti: The Night Masquerade*, Nnedi Okorafor](https://amzn.to/363v4oZ): thankfully picked up from what I felt was a weaker entry in *Binti: Home* and provided a nice & enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy.
- [*Autonomous*, Annalee Newitz](https://amzn.to/2ONmgxQ): [RIYL](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RIYL) *Murderbot Diaries*, but want...way more exploration of robot/human sex.
- [*The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World*, David W. Anthony](https://amzn.to/366zdbV): a great read if you're interested in linguistics, archaeology, or Proto-Indo-European. Anthony persuasively synthesizes a lot of research (much of it not in English) in a readable and informative way.
- [*Bible Nation: The United States of Hobby Lobby*, Candida R. Moss & Joel S. Baden](https://amzn.to/2PgDvqp): if you've been following [the Museum of the Bible papyri scandal](https://www.ees.ac.uk/news/chairmans-statement-to-ees-members), this book (published before all this) provides some absolutely crucial background and context for the relationship between the Greens, Hobby Lobby, the MOTB, and academia.
- [*Ancillary Justice*, Ann Leckie](https://amzn.to/2PgDClP): Space Opera Sci-Fi with well-written AIs and all sorts of parallels to the Roman Empire. I'm here for it.
- [*Whose Body?*, Dorothy L. Sayers](https://amzn.to/2RkLdlG): I've been seeing a lot of praise for Sayers' "Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries" as feel-good, lighthearted, and feminist, so I decided to start with this, which is the first one in the series. What nobody mentioned is that at least *this* book is also rather incredibly casually racist.
- [*Red at the Bone*, Jacqueline Woodson](https://amzn.to/2OOAgan): Sort of like *Fates and Furies*, except instead of being insufferable, it's actually good. OK, that's maybe not fair (or even a good comparison) since I haven't actually finished *F&F*, but I've started it three times, and quit in annoyance each time.
- [*Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World*, Anand Giridharadas](https://amzn.to/2RltQ4g): if you want to understand modern inequality and philanthropy, this is the book for you. It's also really revealing to see excerpts of some early philanthropists like Carnegie talking openly about their assumptions (and hypocrisies) that still underpin philanthropy to this day.
- [*A Dead Djinn in Cairo*, P. Djèlí Clark](https://amzn.to/2OMf2Kl): enjoyable, but I couldn't stop thinking of how much it paralleled Netflix's *Bright*...
