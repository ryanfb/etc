As the Wikipedia *"[Comparison of photogrammetry software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_photogrammetry_software)"* article is somewhat overwhelming, I thought it would be useful to have an up-to-date and curated list of free or inexpensive[^inexpensive] photogrammetry solutions readily available for easy comparison:

|                               | Platform            | | Price                  | Open Source | Creator       |

### Footnotes

[^inexpensive]: Here I take "inexpensive" to mean <$200/yr. I also am uninterested in Windows-only solutions.
[^photoscancompare]: See <http://www.agisoft.com/features/compare/> to check features against the considerably more expensive "Professional" version ([$3499](http://www.agisoft.com/buy/online-store/), [$549 educational](http://www.agisoft.com/buy/online-store/educational-license/)).
[^ppt]: The "Python Photogrammetry Toolbox" seems to be a term used somewhat interchangeably for various things: [osm-bundler](https://code.google.com/p/osm-bundler/) (a Python processing pipeline around Bundler/PMVS/CMVS), a [Python GUI for this pipeline](https://github.com/archeos/ppt-gui/blob/master/ppt-gui-package/usr/share/archeos/osm-bundler/linux/ppt_gui.py), and the [ArcheOS Linux distribution](http://www.archeos.eu) which aggregates all these together.
