# Books
- [*The Lathe of Heaven*, Ursula K. Le Guin](https://amzn.to/3ehf8nV): classic Sci-Fi, I thought this might be a nice short distraction from current events, and although it's...really not...it's still an amazing book.
- [*Homer's Odyssey 6-8: Greek Text with Facing Vocabulary and Commentary*, Geoffrey D. Steadman](https://amzn.to/2JWNIpt): also [freely available online](https://geoffreysteadman.com/homers-odyssey-6-8/), this was March's reading for the [Steadman Reading Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/steadman-greek-reading-group) - though this was my first foray into really reading the *Odyssey* instead of the *Iliad* in Greek, I found this quite enjoyable and far easier than the *Iliad* because I can keep the events of the *Odyssey* much straighter in my head.
- [*This Land is Our Land: The Struggle for a New Commonwealth*, Jedediah Purdy](https://amzn.to/34RoWRx)
- [*Sixteenth Watch*, Myke Cole](https://amzn.to/2yNA2uE)
- [*Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto*, Chuck Klosterman](https://amzn.to/34ue5ws)
