title: "Photius: The Bibliotheca"

Photius' (or Photios') *Bibliotheca* is a gigantic 9th century CE collection of notes on some 280 books (many of which have since been lost). The modern edition of the Greek text runs to some 1,600 pages, and most translations into modern languages have been selective or partial:

 * G. Compagnoni, Italian, selected, 1836. [Available online](https://archive.org/details/bibliotecadifoz00photgoog/).
 * La Rue Van Hook, English, selected excerpts, [1907](https://www.jstor.org/stable/282739) (excerpts of entries 259-268) & [1909](https://www.jstor.org/stable/261825).
 * J.H. Freese, English, entries 1-165, 1920. [Available online](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_03bibliotheca.htm).
 * Adolf von Harnack, English, entry 232, [1923](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/harnack_stephen_gobar.htm).
 * René Henry, French, complete, 1959-1977.
 * Claudio Bevegni, Italian, selected, 1992.
 * N.G. Wilson, English, selected, 1994.

Of note is that Wilson selected the passages which Bevegni translated, so both selections are the same for those translations. Unfortunately, as noted by Wilson and most reviewers, Henry's translation into French "is marred by a fair number of errors" (Wilson, p.20). Some of Henry's translations have, however, been translated into English by Roger Pearse and [put online with the permission of the copyright holder](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/).

The [table of contents for Wilson's translation can be viewed here](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/photius-the-bibliotheca-9780715626122/), but I thought it would be useful to collect together those entries which are translated by Wilson, but not by Henry/Pearse or Freese:

* `183-184.` Eudocia, *Paraphrase of the Octateuch*, *Paraphrase of Zacharia*, and *Paraphrase of Daniel*
* `199.` John Moscus, *Pratum spirituale*, or *Spiritual meadow*, or *New Paradise*
* `202.` Hippolytus, *Commentary on Daniel*
* `203.` Theodoret, *Commentary on the book of Daniel* (= *Patrologia graeca* 81.1246-1545)
* `206-207.` Procopius of Gaza, *On the Octateuch of the Old Testament*, *On the book of Kings*, *On the Paralipomena*, and *On the prophet Isaiah*
* `212.` Aenesidemus, *Pyrrhonian writings*
* `214.` Hierocles, *On providence and destiny*
* `216-217.` Oreibasius, medical treatises (218-219 also deal with similar material from Oreibasius)
* `223.` Diodoros of Tarsus, *Against predestination*
* `249.` *Life of Pythagoras*
* `251.` Hierocles, extracts from *On providence and destiny*, the work discussed in 214 above. This entry consists of three such extracts, Wilson translates the last of the three (465a-466b)
* `252.` *Life of St Gregory*
* `253.` *The Martyrdom of the Seven Child Saints*
* `258.` *Life of Athanasius*
* `260.` *Isocrates*, from ps.-Plutarch's *Lives of the ten orators*, encompassing entries 259-268
* `262.` *Lysias*, from ps.-Plutarch's *Lives of the ten orators* (see 260 above)
