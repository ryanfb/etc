A question I often see (and wonder myself) is: "What's the best textbook for learning Ancient Greek?". There are enough (modern) Ancient Greek textbooks that even keeping them all straight is a little confusing. So this post is just a roundup of the major textbooks for Ancient Greek that I'm aware of.[^modern]

Note that this list is primarily focused on Attic Greek,[^dialect] and many are designed for a classroom setting, making them more difficult if you intend to learn on your own.[^gt]

Many of these are gleaned from two Twitter threads I have bookmarked, where you can go to get a variety of opinions on the relative merits of them (as well as some other textbooks off the beaten path):

Another excellent resource is Juan Coderch's [Teaching Ancient Languages: a selected guide to available material](http://coderch-greek-latin-grammar.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/8/5/11853710/teaching_ancient_languages.pdf) (PDF), which discusses grammars, textbooks, and other resources for Ancient Greek & Latin.

### Footnotes:

[^modern]: There are also a large number of 18th, 19th, and even earlier-20th century Greek textbooks not mentioned here, many of which [are freely available online](https://www.edonnelly.com/google.html#8) (see also [this list of open access resources at AWOL](http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/09/open-access-textbooks.html), with [some new exciting developments in this area as well](https://thepatrologist.com/2018/02/22/an-entree-into-the-world-of-18th-and-19th-century-greek-textbooks/)). There are also some Greek grammars which are so generally useful that everyone still actually uses them. The most notable of these is probably Herbert Weir Smyth's [*A Greek Grammar for Colleges*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007%3Apart%3D1%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D1) (also on [the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/agreekgrammarfo00smytgoog) or [in print](http://amzn.to/2oDbnRD)). Another is W.W. Goodwin's [*Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0065%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D1) ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/syntaxofmoodsten00gooduoft), [CUP reprint of 1867 edition](http://amzn.to/2oDcy3v), [BMCR review of Cambridge reprint](http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2012/2012-01-17.html), [Bristol reprint of 1889 edition](http://amzn.to/2F6NHPH)), often referred to simply as "GMT".
[^dialect]: For the Homeric dialect, see the resources listed in my post "[Resources for Reading Homeric Greek]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-25-resources_for_reading_homeric_greek %})". For Koine Greek, see Mounce's [*Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar*](http://amzn.to/2oKeeIv) or Croy's [*A Primer of Biblical Greek*](http://amzn.to/2FVjrVp), among others.
[^gt]: Note also that most of these are oriented around the [grammar-translation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar%E2%80%93translation_method). The major [direct method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_method_(education)) text I'm aware of for Ancient Greek is [the Italian *Athenaze*](https://thepatrologist.com/2017/07/03/so-you-want-to-know-about-the-italian-athenaze/). There are also a variety of graded readers, perhaps one of the most well-known being W.H.D. Rouse's [*A Greek Boy at Home*](https://archive.org/details/greekboyathomest01rousuoft) (+ [vocab](https://archive.org/details/greekboyathomest00rousuoft)), designed to go alongside his [*First Greek Course*](https://archive.org/details/FirstGreekCourse) and [*Greek Reader*](https://archive.org/details/greekreader00rousuoft). There have been some modern adaptations of *AGBAH* as well, such as [*Alexandros: To Hellenikon Paidion*](http://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/linguagraeca.htm). And since we're here, there's also the Polis Institute's [*Polis*](http://amzn.to/2oKGHx3) for spoken Ancient Greek.
