title: Typing Ancient Greek on ChromeOS
---

The [Alternative Greek Keyboard Layouts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alternative-greek-keyboar/nbclmofnhpkggnndkdeleaefmbkibmjg?hl=en) extension for ChromeOS will let you type polytonic Greek on your ChromeBook, but the documentation isn't great. Here's the shortcuts I've found for the "Greek Polytonic" layout:

* `:` smooth breathing
* `"` rough breathing
* `;` acute
* `'` grave
* `[` circumflex
* `]` iota subscript
* `q` ;
* `Q` :

I haven't yet found a key for middot (·, ano teleia), but I'd love to be wrong!
